-- These views inner join on clan info for clan rankings. Sadly mysql's query
-- optimizer will not skip a specified join, even in the case of an eq_ref
-- inner join where the joined on columns aren't used in the outer select.

-- If we run into performance issues in generating player ranks we'll need to
-- split out clan and player queries, however the clan join is still needed
-- for clan ranking so the savings won't be much.
